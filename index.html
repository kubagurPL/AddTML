  <h3>Please don't submit anything malicious. I'm going to check everything that gets sent in to be sure, but I'd rather not give anyone a virus or anything like that.</h3>
  <h3>I hope you have fun!</h3>
  <h3>Just as a side note: I made this website in like 30 minutes after thinking about it for about 2, so don't expect too much too fast.</h3>
