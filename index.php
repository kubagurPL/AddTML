  <h1>Welcome to AddTML, or ATML. For $1 you can add HTML to this webpage!</h1>
  <h2>For now though, you can get them for free so I can see if anyone is interested.</h2>
  <h2>This is only really a test. If I see anyone actually interested, this'll definitely be updated.</h2>

  <form action='processHTMLreq.php' method=POST>
    <label for=ATML_box>Put your HTML here:</label>
    <input type=text id=ATML_box name=ATML>
    <input type=submit value="Add HTML!">
  </form>
  <h3>Please don't submit anything malicious. I'm going to check everything that gets sent in to be sure, but I'd rather not give anyone a virus or anything like that.</h3>
  <h3>I hope you have fun!</h3>
  <h3>Just as a side note: I made this website in like 30 minutes after thinking about it for about 2, so don't expect too much too fast.</h3>
